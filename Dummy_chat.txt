🙏🏼🌷🙏🏼🌹🙏🏼🌻🙏🏼🌷 *ಪೂರ್ವ ಜನ್ಮದ ಸುಕೃತಗಳು*

*ಆಯುಃ ಕರ್ಮ ಚ ವಿತ್ತಂಚ  ವಿದ್ಯಾ ನಿಧನಮೇವ ಚ |*
*ಪಂಚೈತಾನಿ ಹಿ ಸೃಜ್ಯಂತೆ*
*ಗರ್ಭಸ್ಥಸ್ಯೈವ ದೇಹಿನಃ॥*.

(೧)ಆಯುಷ್ಯ,   
(೨)ಹಿಂದಿನ ಜನ್ಮದಿಂದ ಬರುವ ಕರ್ಮಫಲ,
  (೩)ಹಣ,
    (೪)ಗಳಿಸಬಹುದಾದ ವಿದ್ಯೆ
        (೫) ಮರಣ.
ಈ ಐದು ವಿಷಯಗಳು ಶಿಶು ತಾಯಿಯ ಗರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿರುವಾಗಲೇ ನಿರ್ಣಯವಾಗಿರುತ್ತದೆ.
ಭಾರತೀಯ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹಿಂದಿನ ಜನ್ಮಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾಡಿದ ಪಾಪ-ಪುಣ್ಯಗಳಿಗೆ  ಅನುಗುಣವಾಗಿ ನೀಚ- ಉಚ್ಚ , ಬಡವ- ಬಲ್ಲಿದ,  ಸಾಕ್ಷರ- ನಿರಕ್ಷರ, ರೋಗಿ ನಿರೋಗಿ ಜನ್ಮ ಬರುವದೆಂದು ನಂಬಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.
ಅದರ ವಿವರವನ್ನು ಈ ಸುಭಾಷಿತದಲ್ಲಿ ಕಾಣ ಬಹುದು.

*ಮೊದಲನೆಯದಾಗಿ ಆಯುಷ್ಯ.*

 ಇಂಥ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಗೆ ಇಷ್ಟೇ ಆಯುಷ್ಯ ,
ಇಂಥಲ್ಲಿ ಹೀಗೇ ಮರಣ ಎಂದು ಗರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿರುವಾಗಲೇ
ಬರೆಯಲ್ಪಡುತ್ತದೆ.
ಈ ಹಣೆಬರಹವನ್ನು ತಪ್ಪಿಸಲು ಹರಿಹರ ಬ್ರಹ್ಮರಿಂದಲೂ ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ.

*ಕರ್ಮ* 
    ಎಂದರೆ ನಾವು ಹಿಂದಿನ ಜನ್ಮದಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾಡಿದ ಪಾಪ - ಪುಣ್ಯ ಕರ್ಮಗಳು .ಇವು ನೆರಳಿನಂತೆ ಮುಂದಿನ ಜನ್ಮದಲ್ಲಿ ನಮ್ಮನ್ನು ಹಿಂಬಾಲಿಸುತ್ತವೆ.
ಕರು ಸಾವಿರಾರು ಹಸುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ತನ್ನ ತಾಯಿಯನ್ನೇ ಹುಡುಕಿಕೊಂಡು ಹೋಗುವಂತೆ ಪೂರ್ವಾರ್ಜಿತ ಕರ್ಮಗಳು ನಮ್ಮನು ಬೆಂಬೆತ್ತಿ ಬರುತ್ತವೆ.

*ಹಣ*

ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಿ ಚಂಚಲೆ. ಎಲ್ಲೂ ಕಾಲೂರಿ ನಿಂತವಳಲ್ಲ. ಒಮ್ಮೆ ಏರಿಸುತ್ತಾಳೆ. ದಿಢೀರನೆ ಕೆಡವುತ್ತಾಳೆ. ತಮ್ಮ ಜೀವನದಲ್ಲಿ ಅನೇಕ ಜನ ಕೃಷಿ,ವಾಣಿಜ್ಯೋದ್ಯಮ ,ಕೈಗಾರಿಕೆ ಮುಂತಾದುವುಗಳ ಮೂಲಕ ಶ್ರೀಮಂತರಾಗಲು ಹೊರಟು ಭಾರೀ ಸೋಲುಂಡವರನ್ನು ಕಾಣುತ್ತೇವೆ.
ಆತ ಪಡೆದದ್ದು ಉಣ್ಣಬೇಕೆ ಹೊರತು  ದುಡಿದದ್ದಲ್ಲ.ಇದನ್ನೇ .ಕವಿವಾಣಿ ಹೇಳುವುದು

*"ಸಿರಿಯದು  ನೀರಿನ ತೆರೆಯಂತೆ*
  *ಜೀವನ ಮಿಂಚಿನ ಸೆಳಕಂತೆ*
   *ಅರಿತಿದ ನಡೆ ನೀ ನಿನ್ನಂತೆ*
     *ಅಳಿದೂ ಉಳಿಯುವ ತೆರನಂತೆ......*
ಎಂದು ನಮ್ಮನ್ನು ಎಚ್ಚರಿಸಿದೆ.

*ಶುಚೀನಾಂ ಶ್ರೀಮತಾಂ ಗೇಹೆ ಯೋಗಭ್ರಷ್ಟೋ ಅಭಿಜಾಯತೇ*
ಅಂದರೆ ಯೋಗಿಯಾಗ ಹೊರಟು ಪೂರ್ಣ ಸಿದ್ಧಿ ಪಡೆಯಲಾಗದೇ ಮಡಿದವನು  ಮುಂದಿನ ಜನ್ಮದಲ್ಲಿ ಶ್ರೀಮಂತರ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಜನಿಸುತ್ತಾನೆ ಎಂದು ಗೀತೆ ಸಾರುತ್ತದೆ.

*ವಿದ್ಯೆ*

ಹಿಂದಿನ ಜನ್ಮದಲ್ಲಿ ದೊಡ್ಡ ವಿದ್ಯಾವಂತನಾಗಲು ಹೊರಟು ಅಲ್ಲಿ 
ಸಫಲತೆ ಯನ್ನು ಪಡೆಯದೇ ಹೋದವನು , ಆ ಸಂಸ್ಕಾರ ಬಲ ದಿಂದ  ಮುಂದಿನ ಜನ್ಮದಲ್ಲಿ ಹುಟ್ಟಿನಿಂದಲೇ ಪ್ರತಿಭಾವಂತನಾಗಿ ಜನಿಸುತ್ತಾನೆ.  ಒಂದೇ ತರಗತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಓದುವ ಮಕ್ಕಳಲ್ಲಿ  ಅಜ-ಗಜಾಂತರವಿರುವುದನ್ನು ಕಾಣುತ್ತೇವೆ. ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಪೂರ್ವ ಜನ್ಮದ
ಸಂಸ್ಕಾರ ಹಾಗೂ ಅದರ ಅಭಾವವೇ ಕಾರಣ.

*ಮರಣ* 
ಮರಣವೂ ಅಷ್ಟೆ.ಇಂಥವನಿಗೆ ಹೀಗೆ , ಇಂತಲ್ಲಿ ಮರಣವೆಂಬುದು ಮೊದಲೇ ಬರೆದಿರುತ್ತದೆ.

ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ಮುಂದೆ ಒಳ್ಳೆಯ ಜನ್ಮ ,ದೀರ್ಘ ಆಯುಷ್ಯ ,ಆರೋಗ್ಯ , ವಿದ್ಯೆ , ವಿತ್ತ,(ಹಣ)ಎಲ್ಲವೂ ಬೇಕೆಂದು ಬಯಸುವವರು  ಈ ಜನ್ಮದಲ್ಲೇ ಎಚ್ಚೆತ್ತು ಒಳ್ಳೆಯ ಕಾರ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರತರಾಗುವುದು ಒಳಿತು. 

 *ಶ್ರೀ ಕೃಷ್ಣಾರ್ಪಣಮಸ್ತು*

11/18/21, 4:56 PM - Kavvi: *I grew up in Bangalore NOT Bengaluru.....*   
Regardless of the weather, our dinner time was at 8:00 pm  and bed time was 09:30 pm 

Eating out at a restaurant was a huge deal, a rarity actually, that only happened when it was a birthday or a very special occasion to celebrate. 

There was no such thing as fast food every other day, and having a bottle of soft drinks and an ice-cream from the local shop was a real treat. Pass your final exams and you might have gotten a new set of clothes, or Bata shoes. 

You took your school clothes off as soon as you got home and put on your ‘home’ clothes. There was no taking or picking you up in the car, you either boarded the school bus or rode on public transport, or just walked home. You got home did your chores and homework before dinner. 

Not everyone had a house phone and much later, all private conversation were at PCO booths.

We didn’t have appletv AmazonPrime or Netflix. We had only Doordarshan to watch. Jungle Book came once a week on a Sunday and Chhaya Geet on Thursdays, for which we waited all week.

We played chor police, lappa chuppi, Football, Cricket, lagori, dabba ice-spice (actually it was “I spy”) Marbles and any other game we could come up with...  At home, we stuck to chess, carom, ludo, snakes and ladders, Scrabble and Monopoly. 

Staying shut in the house was a PUNISHMENT and the only thing we knew about "bored" was --- "You better find something to do before I find it for you!"

Life was good without insta, facebook, twitter.
Followers were the friends standing behind you. 

We played music via magnetic tapes or radio. A walkman was a luxury for the uber rich.

We went to the local shop for groceries and chiclets, jeera goli, kismi, which used to be a couple of paise.

We ate what Mum made for dinner and put in our lunch and snack box.
Bottled water was non existent. We drank from the school water tank. No wonder we are so immune.

We called our friends from home by shouting their names from the street.

We weren't AFRAID OF ANYTHING.  We played until dark... sunset was our alarm.

If someone had a fight, that's what it was and we were friends again a day later if not SOONER.

We watched our MOUTHS around our elders because ALL of our aunts, uncles, grandpas, grandmas, AND our parents' best friends were all extensions of our PARENTS and you didn't want them telling your parents you’d misbehaved! Or they would give you something to cry about.

We respected the Police, Firemen, Ambulance workers, Teachers, Doctors and Nurses. 

We never answered back... ever!!!

We got detention at school for not doing homework, no hair cut, being late to class or being naughty. Our teachers spanked us when we deserved it and our parents did not complain about it. If we complained to our parents, we got spanked again 

We did not know what luxury was. Our simple lives were so good.

Those were the good days. So many kids today will never know how it feels to be a real kid.  

I loved my childhood and all the friends I hung around with. 

Share if you are from the same generation.

12/5/21, 10:04 PM - JaSai: *Tirumala Tirupati Advisory*
*Issued in Public Interest*

Postpone any plans to Tirumala by a few weeks/months. The Landslide damaged road are under repairs. Only one side of the road is currently operational. Thousands of vehicles stand in a long queue waiting to drive up the hills. Vehicles are sent in an hourly manner. May be an inconvenient wait for elderly, young restless children and women who want to use restrooms. As expected, the typical Indian-jugaad sales guys have started selling Tea, Bajji, Snacks etc. using this opportunity. Those willing to wait, there are no issues. Those with health issues, better to avoid.

*Update as on Friday, 3rd December | 4:41PM*

12/6/21, 10:05 AM - JaSai: *I've read this atleast 5 times since this morning. It's so true and beautifully written*

💛 *The journey is short*💛 *MAKE IT MEMORABLE*

A  woman climbed up the bus and sat down beside a man, hitting him with her numerous bags.

When the man remained silent,  the woman asked him why he did not complain when she hit him with her bags ?

The man replied with a Smile: 
"There is no need to be upset about something so insignificant, 
as our journey together is so short, 
because I'm getting off at the next stop "🥰

This answer disturbed the woman so much , she asked the man to excuse her  and thought the words needs to be written in✍ gold 💛

Each of us must understand that our time in this world is so short, 
that darkening it with useless arguments, jealousy, not forgiving others, discontentment and bad attitudes are a ridiculous waste of time and energy.

Did someone break your heart?  Stay calm.
The trip is too short.💛

Did someone betray you, intimidate, cheat or humiliate you? 
Relax - Don't be Stressed
The trip is too short.💛

Did someone insult you without reason? 
Stay calm. Ignore it.
The trip is too short.💛

Did some  one make a comment  that you didn't like? 
Stay calm. Ignore. Forgive, keep them in your prayers & love them still for no reason. 
The trip is too short.💛

Whatever the problems some bring to us, 
it is a problem only if we think of it, remember 
that our journey together is too short.💛

No one knows the length of our trip. No one has seen tomorrow. Nobody knows when it will arrive at its stop.

Our trip together is too short.💛

Let us appreciate friends and family. Keep them in good humor. Respect them. Let us be respectful, kind, loving & forgiving.

Because we will be filled with gratitude and joy, after all Our trip together is very short.💛

_*ಅಡುಗೆಮನೆ ಕೆಲ್ಸ ಅಂದ್ರೆ....*
_.... *ಬೇಯ್ಸೋದಷ್ಟೇ ಅಲ್ಲ!*

*ಕೊತ್ತಂಬರಿ, ಕರಿಬೇವು, ಮೆಣಸಿನಕಾಯಿ, ನಿಂಬೇಹಣ್ಣು, ಶುಂಠಿ ಕೆಡದೇ ಇರೋ ಹಾಗೆ ಮ್ಯಾನೇಜ್ ಮಾಡೋ ಕಲೆ ಇರಬೇಕು.*

*ಯಾವ್ಯಾವ ತರಕಾರಿ ಎಷ್ಟು ದಿನ ಫ್ರೆಷ್ ಇರುತ್ತೆ, ಯಾವುದು ಬೇಗ ಹಾಳಾಗುತ್ತೆ, ಅನ್ನೋದು ಗೊತ್ತಿರ್ಬೇಕು.*

*ಗೊತ್ತಿದ್ದರಷ್ಟೇ ಸಾಲದು; ದಿನಾ ಒಂದೇ ತರ ಅಡುಗೆ ಮಾಡದೆ ವಿಧ ವಿಧವಾದ ಅಡುಗೆ ರುಚಿ ರುಚಿಯಾಗಿ ತಯಾರಿಸಿ ಅಡುಗೆ ಮನೆ ನಿಭಾಯಿಸೋ ಕಲೆ ಇರಬೇಕು.*

*ಯಾವಯಾವ ದಿನಸಿ, ಎಷ್ಟೆಷ್ಟು ಬೇಕು, ಎಂಬ ಲೆಕ್ಕಾಚಾರ ಗೊತ್ತಿರಬೇಕು. ತಂದ ದಿನಸಿಯನ್ನು ಹಾಳಾಗದಂತೆ ಕಾಪಾಡುವ ಸ್ಟೋರ್ಸ್ ಮ್ಯಾನಾಜ್‌ಮೆಂಟ್ ಗೊತ್ತಿರಬೇಕು.*

12/11/21, 11:28 AM - Jayamma: ಸದಾ ಹಸಿರು ತುಂಬಿರುವ  ಅರಳಿಮರ:- 

ಇದು ತ್ರೇತಾಯುಗದಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆದ ಕಥೆ. ದಶರಥನ ಪತ್ನಿ ಕೈಕೆಯ ಕಾರಣದಿಂದಾಗಿ ಶ್ರೀರಾಮನು ಹದಿನಾಲ್ಕು ವರ್ಷ ವನವಾಸಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗಬೇಕಾಗಿ ಬಂದಿದ್ದು  ಎಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ತಿಳಿದ ವಿಚಾರ.  ಶ್ರೀ ರಾಮನು ವನವಾಸಕ್ಕೆ ಹೊರಟಾಗ ಅವನ ಜೊತೆ ಮಡದಿ ಸೀತಾಮಾತೆ ಮತ್ತು ತಮ್ಮ ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಣನು ಬರುತ್ತೇನೆ  ಎಂದು ಹೊರಟರು.  ಅವರೆಲ್ಲಾ ವನವಾಸಕ್ಕೆ ಹೊರಟ ಮೇಲೆ ಅಯೋಧ್ಯೆಯಲ್ಲಿ  ರಾಜಾ ದಶರಥನು  ರಾಮನ ಯೋಚನೆಯಲ್ಲಿಯೇ ಕೊರಗಿ ಕೊರಗಿ ಹಾಸಿಗೆ ಹಿಡಿದು ಕೊನೆಗೆ  ಪ್ರಾಣತ್ಯಾಗ ಮಾಡಿದನು. ನಾಲ್ಕು ಜನ ಗಂಡು ಮಕ್ಕಳಿದ್ದರೂ ದಶರಥನು ಸಾಯುವ ಕಾಲದಲ್ಲಿ ಒಬ್ಬರು ಇಲ್ಲದಂತಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.  ಇದಕ್ಕೆಲ್ಲಾ ದಶರಥನಿಗೆ ಋಷಿ ದಂಪತಿಗಳು ಕೊಟ್ಟ ಶಾಪ. 

ವನವಾಸಕ್ಕೆ ಹೊರಟ ರಾಮ-ಸೀತೆ ಮತ್ತು ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಣರು, ಪುಣ್ಯಕ್ಷೇತ್ರ ಗಳನ್ನೆಲ್ಲಾ ದರ್ಶನ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಾ ,  ಪವಿತ್ರವಾದ ಗಯಾ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರಕ್ಕೆ ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ. ರಾಮ- ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಣರು ತಂದೆಯಾದ ದಶರಥನಿಗೆ ಪಿಂಡ ಪ್ರದಾನ ಮಾಡುವ ಸಲುವಾಗಿ ಸೀತಾಮಾತೆಯನ್ನು  ಗಯಾ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರದ   ಫಲ್ಗುಣಿ ನದಿ ದಡದಲ್ಲಿ ಕುಳಿತಿರಲು ಹೇಳಿ  ಅವರಿಬ್ಬರು  ಹಣ್ಣುಹಂಪಲುಗಳನ್ನು ತರಲು ಕಾಡಿಗೆ ಹೋಗುತ್ತಾರೆ.  ಸೀತಾಮಾತೆಯು  ಅವರಿಬ್ಬರ ಬರುವನ್ನೇ ಕಾಯುತ್ತಾ ಕುಳಿತಿರುವಾಗ, ಇದ್ದಕ್ಕಿದ್ದಂತೆ ನದಿಯೊಳಗಿಂದ  ಕೈಯೊಂದು ಹೊರಗೆ ಬಂದು ಸೀತಾಮಾತೆಯ ಮುಂದೆ ಚಾಚುತ್ತದೆ.  ಇದನ್ನು ನೋಡಿದ  ಹೆದರಿದ ಸೀತೆ ಅಲ್ಲಿದ್ದ ಬಂಡೆಯ ಹಿಂದೆ ನಿಂತು ಚಾಚಿದ  ಕೈಯನ್ನೇ ನೋಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದಳು. 

ಎಲ್ಲಿಂದಲೋ ಒಂದು ಅಶರೀರವಾಣಿ ಕೇಳುತ್ತದೆ.   ಸೀತಾ ನನಗೆ ಹಸಿವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ ಎಂದು ಹೇಳಿದಂತಾಯಿತು.  ಎರಡು-ಮೂರು ಸಲ ಅದೇ ರೀತಿ ಕೂಗಿದಾಗ ಆ ದ್ವನಿ ದಶರಥ ಮಹಾರಾಜನದು ಎಂದು ಅವಳಿಗೆ ತಿಳಿಯುತ್ತದೆ.  ಸೀತೆಗೆ ಏನು ಮಾಡುವುದೆಂದು ತಿಳಿಯಲಿಲ್ಲ . ಏನಾದರೂ ಮಾಡಲು ಅಲ್ಲಿ ಪದಾರ್ಥಗಳು ಇರಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಇದುವರೆಗೂ  ಕೇಳಿದವರಿಗೆಲ್ಲ ಯಥೇಚ್ಛವಾಗಿ ಕೊಟ್ಟವಳು ಸೀತಾಮಾತೆ. ಈಗ ಹಸಿದವರಿಗೆ  ಆಹಾರ ಇಲ್ಲ ಎನ್ನುವುದು ಮಹಾಪಾಪ.  ಹೀಗಿರುವಾಗ ಏನು ಮಾಡಲಿ ಎಂದು ಚಡಪಡಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದಳು.  ಹಸಿವು ಎಂದು ಆಹಾರ ಕೇಳುತ್ತಿರುವುದು ಅಯೋಧ್ಯೆಯ ಮಹಾರಾಜ, ಶ್ರೀರಾಮನ ತಂದೆ, ನನಗೆ ಮಾವ, ಯೋಚಿಸಿ ಕೊನೆಗೆ ದಾರಿಕಾಣದೆ ನದಿ ದಡದಲ್ಲಿದ್ದ ಮಣ್ಣನ್ನೇ  ತೆಗೆದು ಮೂರು ಉಂಡೆ ಮಾಡಿ,  ಅದರೊಳಗೆ ಅನ್ನವನ್ನು ಆವಾಹನೆ ಮಾಡಿ ಚಾಚಿದ ಕೈಗಳ ಮೇಲೆ ಇಡುತ್ತಾಳೆ.  ಈ ರೀತಿ ಮಾಡಿದ ಕೆಲಸಕ್ಕೆ ಅಲ್ಲಿಯೇ ಇದ್ದ ಐವರು ಸಾಕ್ಷಿಯಾಗುತ್ತಾರೆ.  ದಶರಥನು ಇದರಿಂದ ಸಂತೃಪ್ತನಾಗಿ ಆಶೀರ್ವದಿಸಿ ಮಾಯವಾಗುತ್ತಾನೆ.   ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ ರಾಮ ಮತ್ತು ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಣ ಹಣ್ಣು ಹಂಪಲುಗಳನ್ನು ಸಂಗ್ರಹಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು  ತರುತ್ತಾರೆ.  ಇಲ್ಲೀತನಕ ನಡೆದದ್ದನ್ನೆಲ್ಲಾ ಸೀತೆಯು  ಅವರಿಗೆ ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾಳೆ.‌  ಆದರೆ ರಾಮ- ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಣರು ಇದನ್ನು ನಂಬುವುದಿಲ್ಲ . ಇದನ್ನು ಗ್ರಹಿಸಿದ ಸೀತೆಯು ತಾನು ಸಾಕ್ಷಿಯಾಗಿರಿಸಿಕೊಂಡ ವರನ್ನು ತೋರಿಸಿ ರಾಮ ಮತ್ತು ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಣ ರಿಗೆ ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾಳೆ ಇವರೇ ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಸಾಕ್ಷಿಗಳು ಎಂದು. 

ಮುಂದೆ ಬಂದು ನಡೆದ ಘಟನೆಯನ್ನು ಹೇಳಿ ಎಂದು ಕೇಳಿಕೊಂಡರೆ, ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ಫಲ್ಗುಣಿ ನದಿ, ಹಸು, ಬ್ರಾಹ್ಮಣ, ತುಳಸಿಗಿಡ, ಹೇಳಲಿಚ್ಛಿಸಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಅರಳಿಮರ ಮಾತ್ರ ಎಲ್ಲವನ್ನೂ ಬಿಡದಂತೆ ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿ ವಿವರಿಸಿ ರಾಮನಿಗೆ ಹೇಳಿತು.  ರಾಮಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಣರು ಇದನ್ನು ಕೇಳಿ ಸೀತೆಯ ಸಮಯಪ್ರಜ್ಞೆಯನ್ನು ಮೆಚ್ಚಿ ಹೊಗಳಿದರು. 

ಆದರೆ ಸಾಕ್ಷಿ ಹೇಳಲು ಹಿಂಜರಿದಂಥ  ಪಲ್ಗುಣಿ ನದಿ, ಬ್ರಾಹ್ಮಣ, ಹಸು ಮತ್ತು ತುಳಸಿ ಗಿಡದ, ಮೇಲೆ ಸೀತಾಮಾತೆಗೆ ಸಿಟ್ಟುಬಂದು ಅವುಗಳಿಗೆ ಶಾಪ ಕೊಡುತ್ತಾಳೆ.  ಫಲ್ಗುಣಿ ನದಿಗೆ  "ಮಳೆಗಾಲದಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ನೀರಿಲ್ಲದೆ ಬರಿದಾಗಿರು" ಎಂದು ಶಪಿಸುತ್ತಾಳೆ.  ಎರಡನೆಯದಾಗಿ  ಬ್ರಾಹ್ಮಣನಿಗೆ  "ಹೇ ವಿಪ್ರೋತ್ತಮರೆ, ನೀವು  ನಡೆದ ಸತ್ಯವನ್ನು ಹೇಳದೆ ನನಗೆ ಮೋಸ ಮಾಡಿದಿರಿ  ಇದಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ನೀವು  ಈ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರದಲ್ಲಿಯೇ ಇದ್ದು, ಇಲ್ಲಿಗೆ ಬರುವ ಯಾತ್ರಾರ್ಥಿಗಳನ್ನು ಕೇಳಿ, ಪೀಡಿಸಿ, ಅವರು ಕೊಡುವ ದಾನದ  ಆದಾಯದಿಂದ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಜೀವನ ನಡೆಸುವಂತಾಗಲಿ"  ಎಂದು ಶಾಪ ಕೊಡುತ್ತಾಳೆ.  ಮೂರನೆಯದಾಗಿ ಹಸುವಿಗೆ, "ನೋಡು ಗೋಮಾತೆ  ಸತ್ಯವಂತೆಯಾದ ನೀನೂ  ನನ್ನ ಪರವಾಗಿ ಸಾಕ್ಷಿ ಹೇಳಲು ಹಿಂಜರಿದೆ  ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ನೀನು ಸಹ ಈ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರದಲ್ಲಿಯೇ  ಇದ್ದು, ಯಾತ್ರಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ಬಂದು ಪಿತೃ ಕಾರ್ಯಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಇಡುವ ಪಿಂಡಗಳನ್ನೆ ನೀನು ಆಹಾರವಾಗಿ  ತಿನ್ನಬೇಕು ಅದರಿಂದ  ಎಂದಿಗೂ ನಿನ್ನ ಹೊಟ್ಟೆತುಂಬದಿರಲಿ" ಎಂದು ಶಪಿಸುತ್ತಾಳೆ. ಇನ್ನು ನಾಲ್ಕನೆಯದಾಗಿ ತುಳಸಿ ಗಿಡಕ್ಕೆ, "ಎಷ್ಟೊಂದು ಪವಿತ್ರಳಾದವಳು, ಪುಣ್ಯವಂತೆ, ಎಂದುಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದೆ. ಆದರೆ ನೀನು ಸಹ ನಿಜವನ್ನು ಹೇಳಲಿಲ್ಲ.  ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ನೀನು ಎಲ್ಲೆಂದರಲ್ಲಿ ಹುಟ್ಟಿ ಬೆಳೆಯುವಂತಹ  ಗಿಡವಾಗು"  ಎಂದು ಶಾಪ ಕೊಟ್ಟಳು. 

ಸೀತೆಯು ಕೊಟ್ಟ ಶಾಪದಂತೆ ಗಯಾ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಫಲ್ಗುಣಿ ನದಿ ಬತ್ತಿದೆ.
ನದಿ ತೀರದಲ್ಲಿ ಇರುವ ಹಸುಗಳಿಗೆ ಅವರಿವರು ಇಡುವ  ಪಿಂಡದ ಅನ್ನವೇ ಆಹಾರವಾಗಿದೆ.  ಉಳಿದಂತೆ  ಬ್ರಾಹ್ಮಣನಿಗೆ  ಯಾತ್ರಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ಕೊಡುವ ಪುಡಿಗಾಸುಗಳೇ  ಬದುಕಿಗೆ ಆದಾಯವಾಗಿದೆ. ಕೊನೆಯದಾಗಿ ತನ್ನ ಪರವಾಗಿ ರಾಮ- ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಣರಿಗೆ ಸತ್ಯವನ್ನೇ ಹೇಳಿದ ಅರಳಿ ಮರದ ಕಾರ್ಯವನ್ನು ಮೆಚ್ಚಿ ವರ ಕೊಡುತ್ತಾಳೆ. "ಅರಳಿ ಮರವೇ, ಇಂದಿನಿಂದ ನೀನು ಎಂದೆಂದೂ ಬಾಡದಂತೆ ಹಚ್ಚ ಹಸಿರಾಗಿರು.  ಭೂಲೋಕದಲ್ಲಿ ದೇವ ವೃಕ್ಷವಾಗಿ ಎಲ್ಲರಿಂದ
ಶ್ರದ್ಧಾಭಕ್ತಿಯಿಂದ  ಪೂಜಿಸಲ್ಪಡು" ಎಂದು ಹರಸಿದಳು. ಈ ರೀತಿಯಿಂದ
ಈ ನಾಲ್ವರು ಸೀತಾಮಾತೆಯ ಶಾಪಕ್ಕೆ ಗುರಿಯಾಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ. 

ವಾಮೇ ಭೂಮಿಸುತಾ ಪುರಶ್ಚಹನುಮಾನ್ ಪಶ್ಚಾತ್ ಸುಮಿತ್ರಾ ಸುತ
ಶತ್ರುಘ್ನೋ  ಭರತಶ್ಚ  ಪಾರ್ಶ್ವದಲಯೋರ್ವಾಯ್ವ್ ದಿ ಕೋಣೆಷುಚ!
ಸುಗ್ರೀವಶ್ಚ  ವಿಭೀಷಣಶ್ಚಯುವರಾಟ್ ತಾರಾಸುತೋ ಜಾಂಬವಾನ್
ಮಧ್ಯೆ ನೀಲ ಸರೋಜಕೋಮಲ ರುಚಿಂ  ರಾಮಂಭಜೇ ಶಾಮಲಂ! 

ತನ್ನ ಜೊತೆ ಸೀತೆಯನ್ನು , ಮುಂದೆ ಹನುಮಂತನನ್ನು  ತನ್ನ ಹಿಂದೆ ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಣನನ್ನೊ,  ಅಕ್ಕಪಕ್ಕಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಶತ್ರುಘ್ನ ಮತ್ತು ಭರತರನ್ನು ಇಟ್ಟುಕೊಂಡು  ಸುಗ್ರೀವ  ವಿಭೀಷಣ ಮತ್ತು ಅಂಗದ ಜಾಂಬುವಂತ ರೊಂದಿಗೆ ಇರುವ ಶ್ರೀರಾಮನನ್ನು ಭಜಿಸುತ್ತೇನೆ.

ವಂದನೆಗಳೊಂದಿಗೆ,
ಬರಹ:- ಆಶಾ ನಾಗಭೂಷಣ.

12/26/21, 7:58 PM - Sumo: We have heard of the Magna Carta which is kept in the Salisbury Cathedral, and recognise it as t he first written “Constitution”. Now read this.

While performing Bhumi Puja for our new Parliament Building, last year our PM mentioned about Uthiramerur. Many of my friends phone me and asked what is that so important to mention.  Here are details .  Uthiramerur  ( Tamil Nadu) model of democracy
Uthiramerur is situated in Kancheepuram district, about 90 km from Chennai. It has a 1,250-year history. There are three important temples. The three temples have a large number of inscriptions, notably those from the reigns of Raja Raja Chola (985-1014 A.D.), his son Rajendra Chola, and the Vijayanagar emperor Krishnadeva Raya. During the period of  Parantaka Chola [907-955 A.D.]  The village administration was honed into a perfect system through elections. In fact, inscriptions on temple walls in several parts of Tamil Nadu refer to village assemblies. “But it is at Uthiramerur on the walls of the village assembly (mandapa) itself that we have the earliest inscriptions with complete information about how the elected village assembly functioned,”  says  R. Sivanandam, epigraphist at the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology.
It testifies to the historical fact that nearly 1,100 years ago, a village had an elaborate and highly refined electoral system and even a written constitution prescribing the mode if elections. The details of this system of elective village democracy are inscribed on the walls of the village assembly (grama sabha mandapa), a rectangular structure made of granite slabs “It is an outstanding document in the history of India. It is a veritable written constitution of the village assembly that functioned 1,000 years ago,”  says Dr. Nagaswamy famous archeologist. The inscription, gives astonishing details about the constitution of wards, the qualification of candidates standing for elections, the disqualification norms, the mode of election, the constitution of committees with elected members, the functions of those committees, the power to remove the wrongdoer, etc…”. The villagers even had the right to recall the elected representatives if they failed in their duty.
What were the salient features? The village was divided into 30 wards, with one representative elected for each. Those who want to contest must be above 35 years of age and below 70. Only those who owned land that attracted tax could contest elections.  Such owners should possess a house built on a legally owned site (not on public poromboke). A person serving in any of the committees could not contest again for the next three terms, each term lasting a year. Elected members who accepted bribes, misappropriated others' property, committed incest, or acted against the public interest suffered disqualification. The entire village, including infants, had to be present at the village assembly mandapa when elections were held. Only the sick and those who had gone on a pilgrimage were exempt.
I first came to know about these not from our history books,  not from my teachers in school and college but from a book of Paramacharya that contains his teachings. In fact,  T.N Sheshan former election commissioner was a bit dejected when he was appointed as Chief Election commissioner.  Met Paramacharya. Paramacharya, who was 97 when a visibly disappointed Seshan came to meet Him, immediately sensed the cause of his disappointment and counseled him to treat the transfer as an opportunity granted by God to serve the Indian public. He had suggested that Seshan visit the Uthiramerur temple and read through the details of electoral regulations prevalent in India about 1000 years ago, including qualifications of candidates that can contest elections.
In the words of Sree. Seshan, ‘The credit for Electoral reforms must go to Kanchi Mahaswami, but for who this would not have been possible. At 97, He had such clarity and described minute details of the electoral rules embossed on the northern walls of the Uthiramerur temple.  And mentioned to me that even implementing a tenth of these reforms, would be a great service to India”. The rest is history. In the words of columnist TJS George, “Seshan showed what one man could do to ensure that democracy did not become a hydra-headed monster. In time Seshan retired. And the monster was set free.”
: I doubt how many of the politicians in TN will know this. It was wonderful that our PM had shared this on national stage so that everyone across the country will know the richness of our culture. The Vishnu temple in Uthiramerur is very unique since the same was built by Viswa Karma and it's the first Ashtanga vimana to be constructed. The vima gvna in Ashtalakshmi temple in Besant nagar, Chennai was designed and built copying this vimana only. Certainly a place to visit to know and understand our richness.

1/11/22, 11:41 PM - Nalini: *Central GOVERNMENT'S BOON FOR SENIOR CITIZENS - MEDICAL CONSULTING TOTALLY FREE*

The Central Government has launched an excellent consulting scheme for senior citizens and all other citizens. 
Elderly people, especially those with high blood pressure, diabetes, etc., don't rush to the hospital for OPD.  They seek treatment at home for minor ailments like headaches, physical pain, and are not ready to go to the hospital. 

You can now access consultancy and treatment on Google Chrome via the link below. Note:

*1*.  Select patient registration.

*2*. Type your mobile number. Type OTP on mobile for registration.

*3*. Enter patient details and district. Now, you will connect with the doctor online. After that, you can consult a doctor for any of your health problems through the video. The doctor will prescribe the medicine online. You can take the medicine by showing it in the medical pharmacy shop.

*This service is completely free.*  
                                      
You can use this service every day from 10.00 am to 3.00 pm, including Sunday.

Please send this to senior citizens in your contact list.

This is the Central Government website: 

*https: //www.eSanjeevaniopd.in*

 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.hied.esanjeevaniopd

Guys this is a fantastic step for senior citizens....
Please take advantage  & Forward it to All Senior Citizens You know.

1/15/22, 7:25 PM - Sumo: *Why of late, Pongal falls on 15th of January every year, as against the usual 14th of January in the earlier years? *
••••••••••••••••••••••••

*Know a small Time calculation process*.

Normally, Makar Sankrant or Pongal Festival should fall on 14th of January every year. Most of us, since childhood, were observing it on 14th of January every year. Isn't it? In fact, from the year 1935 onwards, till 2007, Pongal was falling on 14th January only every year. (Prior to that, know that, from 1862 to 1934, it was falling on 13th of January every year.) But from 2008 onwards, Pongal has been falling on 15th of January every year. Till the Year 2080, it will fall on 15th of January only every year. From the year 2081 onwards, it will fall on 16th of January every year for the next 72 years, that is, till 2153. 

*Why this happens?*

*As per the Indian Almanac Time calculation, Sun enters the Zodiac sign of Makara Raasi (from Dhanur Raasi), 20 Minutes late every year, as compared to the English time or the World Time. Thus, once in 3 years, Sun enters the Makar Raasi late by one hour. That means, in every cycle of 72 years, Sun enters Makar Raasi late by one day. Got it?*

(Also know that Indian Almanac Time is so accurate that our Pandits can accurately tell you today when exactly Solar or Lunar eclipse will take place after 5000 years. That also means that Universe works strictly as per precision timings which is why we can confidently calculate today when exactly will eclipse occur after 5000 years.)

1/15/22, 7:47 PM - Sumo: Did you notice that the alphabet "C" has shot to prominence in this Covid-19 era?
See the Sea of Change that  the alphabet "C" has brought!

No one expected that the alphabet "C" would play a Completely overwhelming  role Compared with any of the other alphabets...

Cough (C)
Cold (C)
Corona virus (C) 
Covid-19 (C) 
Case (C) 
Confirmed (C) 
Confinement (C)  
Contamination (C) 
Containment (C)
Curfew (C) 

Two most serious "C"s  are,
Cemetery (C) 
Cremation (C) 

The possible remedial drug is, Covaxin,
Covishield,
Chloroquine 

The beauty is, it started from China (C)....


But at the same time,
GOD smiled, and said...

Cleanliness (is the remedy...)
Courage (is the need of the hour...)
Compliance to the expert advice...
Contention to overcome the crisis...
Clarity of thought...
Cooperation with the fellow beings...
Caring for the needy... 

and finally....

"Clearance" is awaited and in a Short while..
        
"Cure" is definitely going to "Come"......

Till then take vitamin C.....

1/17/22, 5:55 PM - Sumo: Truly amazing.. Read it once..

🌽A farmer grew award-winning corn. Each year he entered his corn in the state fair where it won a blue ribbon.

One year a newspaper reporter interviewed him and learned something interesting about how he grew it. The reporter discovered that the farmer shared his seed corn with his neighbors. “How can you afford to share your best seed corn with your neighbors when they are entering corn in competition with yours each year?” the reporter asked. “Why sir,” said the farmer, “didn’t you know? 
The wind picks up pollen from the ripening corn and swirls it from field to field. If my neighbours grow inferior corn, cross-pollination will steadily degrade the quality of my corn. If I am to grow good corn, I must help my neighbours grow good corn.”

So is with our lives. Those who want to live meaningfully and well must help enrich the lives of others, for the value of a life is measured by the lives it touches. And those who choose to be happy must help others find happiness, for the welfare of each is bound up with the welfare of all.

Call it power of collectivity.
Call it a principle of success.
Call it a law of life.
The fact is, none of us truly wins, until we all win!!🌽

1/22/22, 8:16 AM - Sumo: Once Arjuna asked Krishna-
 Madhav.. What is this 'successful life'?

 Krishna took Arjuna to fly kites.
 Arjuna was watching Krishna carefully flying a kite.

 After a while Arjuna said-

 Madhav.. Because of this thread, the kite is not able to move freely and upwards, should we break it?  It will go higher.

 Krishna broke the thread..

 The kite went up a little more and then came down after waving and fell at a distant unknown place...

 Then Krishna explained the philosophy of life to Arjuna.
 Parth.. 'The height we are at in life..
 We often feel that certain things to which we are tied are preventing us from going higher;  like :
             -House-
          -family-
        -Dicipline-
       -mother-father-
        -master-and-
           -Society-

 And we want to be free from them...

 In fact, these are the threads - which keep us at that height.

 'Without these threads we will go up once, but later we will have the same fate that happened to a kite without thread...'

 "So, if you want to remain on the top in life, then never break your relationship with these threads."

 * The height attained by successful balance of thread and kite-like attachment is called 'successful life*.."

 : *The end of the Corona virus with this German prevention.*

  German scientists announced, after a series of studies, that the Corona virus not only reproduces in the lungs like the SARS virus in 2002, but also spreads widely in the throat during the first week of infection.
  Scientists suggested to the German chancellor and the Minister of Health that they ask people to do a simple task several times a day, which is to gargle with a semi-hot solution of Abmonak.
  They have long stressed the need to do this, and now, after the results of experiments conducted by German biologists on the multiplication of the Corona virus in the throat, they have emphasized once again the necessity of gargling with a lukewarm solution of water and salt ..

  German scientists assure the German Ministry of Health: if all people clear their throat several times a day by gargling with a semi-hot solution of salt water, then the virus will be completely eliminated throughout Germany within a week.
 Experiments have shown that by gargling with a solution of water and salt, we constantly turn our throats into a completely alkaline environment, and this environment is the worst environment for the coronavirus, because with salt water, the pH of the mouth changes to an alkaline pH, and if we gargle several times a day by gargling with saline  Almost hot, we are not giving the coronavirus a chance to multiply.

  It is therefore necessary for all people to gargle with a semi-hot saline solution several times a day several times a day especially in the morning and before leaving the house and after returning home, so as not to allow the Corona virus to multiply at all in the same initial period.

  Let's ask all people to apply these important and simple health tips with commitment

  As this article goes viral, you too will be in the circle of those fighting the spread of the coronavirus

  Send to your loved ones. Hopefully 🙏 we all can live tension free life my dear friend. Enjoy the weekend 🍾🌹🏏🎂🙏🙋‍♂️

2/4/22, 9:00 PM - Aruna: Can u guess what's common between  these prominent temples:
1. Kedarnath,
2. Kalahashti,
3. Ekambaranatha- Kanchi,
4. Thiruvanamalai,
5. Thiruvanaikaval,
6. Chidambaram Nataraja,
7. Rameshwaram,
8. Kaleshwaram.

If ur answer is, "All are Shiva temples", u r partially correct. It's actually the Longitude in which these temples are located.

"They all are located in 79° longitudes."

What is surprising is that how the architects of these temples many Hundreds of Kilometres apart came up with these precise locations without GPS.

1. Kedarnath 79.0669°
2. Kalahashti 79.7037°
3. Ekambaranatha- Kanchi 79.7036°
4. Thiruvanamalai 79.0747°
5. Thiruvanaikaval 78.7108
6. Chidambaram Nataraja 79.6954°
7. Rameshwaram 79.3129°
8. Kaleshwaram 79.9067°

See the map ...
All are in a straight line.

There are Shiva Temples in India, built in a straight line from "Kedarnath to Rameswaram." 

These temples were Built, 4000 years ago.
So, how was the five temples so accurately established? God Only Knows.
There is a distance of 2383 km between Kedarnath and Rameswaram.

All these temples represent the expression of 5 elements, the Panch Tatva (FIVE Elements), i.e., Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space.

*The Shimmer lamp in Sri Kalahasti is representation of AIR Linga.

*The Water Spring in inner plateau of Thiruvanikka shows WATER Linga.

*The Huge Lamp on Annamalai hill shows that Represent FIRE Linga.

*The Swayambhu Linga of the Sands at Kanchipuram shows EARTH Linga.

*The Incorporeal (NIRAKAR) state of Chidambaram is representing Heavens(AKASH) element of God.

We should be proud of our Ancient Knowledge and Intelligence. It is believed that it is not the only 5 temples but many lie in this line called the "SHIVA-SHAKTI AKSH REKHA."

Amazingly, MAHAKAL has a relationship with all the Jyotirlingam across Country.

The Distance of Jyotirlingams frm Ujjain is:

* Ujjain to Somnath- 777 kms
* Ujjain to Omkareshwar- 111+ kms
* Ujjain to Bhimashankar- 666 kms
* Ujjain to Kashi Vishwanath- 888 kms
* Ujjain to Mallikarjun- 888 kms
* Ujjain to Kedarnath- 1111 kms
* Ujjain to Tryambakeshwar-555 kms
* Ujjain to Badyanath- 1399 kms
* Ujjain to Rameswaram- 1999 kms

"Ujjain is considered to be the centre of the Earth." There was nothing in Hinduism without any reason.

As a centre for 1000's of years in Sanatan Dharma, a man-made instrument for calculating the sun and astrology in Ujjain was built about 2050 years ago.

And, when the imaginary line on Earth was created by British scientist about 100 years ago, the central part of it was Ujjain.
Even today, scientists come to Ujjain to know about the sun and space.

2/8/22, 3:44 PM - Bobby: 8 boys were standing  on a track for racing.

Ready !

Steady !

Bang !

With sound of Pistol all boys started running.

Hardly  had they covered 10 to 15 steps,
1 boy slipped & fell.

 He started crying due to pain.

When other 7 Boys heard him, all of them STOPPED running..

STOOD for a while, 

turned BACK & RAN
towards him.

All the 7 Boys LIFTED the Boy,
pacified him,
joined hands together,
walked together &
reached WINNING Post.

Officials were shocked. 

Many Eyes were
filled with tears.

It happened at Pune.

Race was conducted by
National Institute of
Mental Health...

All participants were
Mentally RETARDED.

What did they teach ?
Teamwork,
Humanity,
Sportsman spirit,
Love,
Care,
&
Equality..

We Surely can NEVER Do this,

because...

We have Brains.... 
We have Ego...
We have Attitude ....and we call them mentality retarded.

ಪ್ರಧಾನವಾಗಿ ದೀಪಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಎರಡು ಕ್ರಮಗಳನ್ನು ಚಿಂತಿಸಬಹುದು. .
1.ನಂದಾದೀಪ. 2 ತಾತ್ಕಾಲಿಕ ದೀಪ.
1.ನಂದಾದೀಪ.
ದಿನವಿಡಿ ನoದಿ ಹೋಗದೇ ದೇವರನ್ನು ಬೆಳಗುವ ದೀಪವೇ ನoದಾದೀಪ.“ನoದ” ಎಂದರೆ “ಭಗವಂತ” (ಆನಂದೋ ನಂದನೋ ನಂದಃ ವಿಷ್ಣುಸಹಸ್ರನಾಮ)
ನಂದಯತಿ ಭಕ್ತಾನ್ ಇತಿ ನಂದಃ 
" ನಂದಾದೀಪ" ಯಾರ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಬೆಳಗುತ್ತದೆಯೋ ಅಂತಹವರ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ದೈವೀ ಪ್ರಭಾವ ಮತ್ತು ಆಧ್ಯಾತ್ಮಿಕ ಶಕ್ತಿ ಹೆಚ್ಚಾಗಿರುತ್ತದೆ.
2. ತಾತ್ಕಾಲಿಕ ದೀಪ.
ಒಮ್ಮೆ ತುಪ್ಪ ಅಥವಾ ಎಣ್ಣೆಯನ್ನು ಹಾಕಿ ಅದು ಉರಿಯುವಷ್ಟು ಕಾಲ ಇಡುವ ದೀಪ.
ದೀಪದ ಅರ್ಥ
ದೀಪ್ಯತೇ ದೀಪಯತಿ  ವಾ ಸ್ವo ಪರಂ ಚೇತಿ ದೀಪಃ |
ತನ್ನನ್ನು ಮತ್ತು ಇತರರನ್ನು ಬೆಳಗುವಂತೆ ತೋರಿಸುವುದೇ ದೀಪ, 
ಭಗವಂತನನ್ನು ತೋರಿಸುವ ವಸ್ತುವೇ ದೀಪ
ರವೇರಸ್ತಂ ಸಮಾರಭ್ಯ ಯಾವತ್ ಸೂರ್ಯೋದಯೋ ಭವೇತ್ |
ಯಸ್ಯ ತಿಷ್ಠತಿ ಗೃಹೇ ದೀಪಃ  ತಸ್ಯ ನಾಸ್ತಿ ದರಿದ್ರತಾ ||
ಸೂರ್ಯಾಸ್ತವಾದ ಕೊಡಲೇ ಗೃಹಿಣಿಯು ದೇವರ ಮುoದೆ ಮಾರನೇ ದಿನ ಸೂರ್ಯೋದಯವಾಗುವವರೆಗೂ
ದೀಪವು ನಂದಿಹೋಗದಂತೆ ನೋಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕು. ಹೀಗೆ ದೀಪ ಬೆಳಗಿದ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಅಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಿಯು ಸುಳಿಯಲಾರಳು. ದಾರಿದ್ರ್ಯವು ಬರಲಾರದು.

ಪೂರ್ವಾಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚುವುದು ಆಯುಃ ಪ್ರದ,ಅಂದರೆ ಆಯುಷ್ಯವನ್ನು ನೀಡುವುದರೊಂದಿಗೆ ಆಯುಷ್ಯಾಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಗೆ ಕಾರಣವಾಗಲಿದೆ.ಉತ್ತರಾಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ಧನ ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತಿ,ಐಶ್ವರ್ಯವನ್ನು ಪಡೆಯುವ ಆಸಕ್ತಿ ಹೆಚ್ಚಾದವರು ಕೂಡಾ ಉತ್ತರಾಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬಹುದು.ಪಶ್ಚಿಮಾಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ದುಃಖ ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತಿ. ದಕ್ಷಿಣಾಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ಹಾನಿ ಉಂಟಾಗುತ್ತದೆ..

ದಕ್ಷಿಣಾಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಎಂದಿಗೂ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬಾರದು..ಅದೇ ರೀತಿ ಹಲವು ದೀಪಗಳನ್ನು ಪಶ್ಚಿಮಾಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿಯೂ ಹಚ್ಚಬಾರದು. ಒಂದೇ ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚುವುದು ದೋಷಪ್ರದ.ಆದಷ್ಟು ಎರಡು ಕಡೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚುವುದು ಉತ್ತಮ. 
ಘೃತ ದೀಪೋ ಭವೇದ್ದಕ್ಷೇ ತೈಲ ದೀಪಸ್ತು ವಾಮತಃ||
ತುಪ್ಪದ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ದೇವರ ಬಲಗಡೆಗೂ.ಎಣ್ಣೆಯ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ದೇವರ ಎಡಭಾಗಕ್ಕೂ ಹಚ್ಚ ಬೇಕು...ಇದು ಒಂದೇ ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚುವಾಗ.. ಹಲವು ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚುವಾಗ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಕಡೆ ಹಚ್ಚ ಬಹುದು. ಇದು ಎಲ್ಲಾ ದೇವರಿಗೂ ಅನ್ವಯಿಸುತ್ತದೆ.
 ದೀಪೇನ ದೀಪಂ ಪ್ರಜ್ವಾಲ್ಯ ದರಿದ್ರೋ ವ್ಯಾಧಿಮಾನ್ ಭವೇತ್||
ಒಂದು ದೀಪದಿಂದಲೇ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ದರಿದ್ರನು,ರೋಗಿಯು ಆಗುವನು.
ದೀಪೇ ಶಲಾಕಾಂ ಪ್ರಜ್ವಾಲ್ಯ ತೇನ ದೀಪಪ್ರಜ್ವಾಲನಂ ಕಾರ್ಯಂ ನ ತು ಸಾಕ್ಷಾದ್ದೀಪೇ||
ಒಂದು ದೀಪದಿಂದ ಬೇರೆ ಬತ್ತಿ ಅಥವಾ  ತುಳಸಿಯ ಕಡ್ಡಿಯಿಂದ ಜ್ವಾಲೆ ಹೊತ್ತಿಸಿ ಬೇರೆ ದೀಪ ಬೆಳಗಬೇಕು.
ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮೀದೇವಿಯ ಸನ್ನಿಧಾನ ವಿಶೇಷವಿರುವ ತುಳಸಿ ಕಾಷ್ಠದಿoದ ದೇವರಿಗೆ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ಭಗವಂತನು ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಸಂತುಷ್ಟನಾಗುವನು.

 ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಯಾವ ಯಾವ ಪಾತ್ರೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹಚ್ಚಬೇಕು.

* ಮಣ್ಣಿನ ಪಾತ್ರೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ದೇವರಿಗೆ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿದ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಯು ಜ್ಞಾನಿಯು , ಯೋಗಿಯು ಹಾಗೂ ಸುಖವಂತನು ಆಗುತ್ತಾನೆ . 
*ಕಬ್ಬಿಣದ ಪಾತ್ರೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚುವವನಿಗೆ ಅಂತಹ ಒಂದು ನೂರು ದೀಪಗಳನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಫಲ ಸಿದ್ಧಿಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ . 
*ಕಂಚಿನ ಪಾತ್ರೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ತೇಜಸ್ಸು ಮತ್ತು ಉತ್ತಮವಾದ ಸೌಭಾಗ್ಯ ಹೆಚ್ಚುತ್ತದೆ . 
*ತಾಮ್ರದ ಪಾತ್ರೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಯಾವನು ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚುತ್ತಾನೋ ಅವನು ಒಂದು ಸಾವಿರ ದೀಪಗಳನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿ ಭಗವಂತನಿಗೆ ಸಮರ್ಪಿಸಿದರೆ ಹೇಗೋ ಹಾಗೆ ಮತ್ತು ಅಷ್ಟು ಉತ್ತಮವಾದ ಫಲವನ್ನು ಪಡೆಯುತ್ತಾನೆ .
* ಬೆಳ್ಳಿಯ ಪಾತ್ರೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಯಾವನು ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚುತ್ತಾನೋ ಅವನ ಪುಣ್ಯವು ಲಕ್ಷ ಪಾಲು ಹೆಚ್ಚುತ್ತದೆ . 
*ಬಂಗಾರದ ಪಾತ್ರೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಯಾವನು ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿ ಶ್ರೀಹರಿಗೆ ಸಮರ್ಪಿಸುತ್ತಾನೋ ಅವನಿಗೆ ಅನಂತ ಫಲವು ಉಂಟಾಗುತ್ತದೆ . ಮತ್ತು ಅವನು ಶ್ರೀಹರಿಯನ್ನೇ ಹೊಂದುತ್ತಾನೆ . ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ಒಟ್ಟಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಮಣ್ಣಿನ ಕಬ್ಬಿಣದ ಕಂಚಿನ- ತಾಮ್ರದ - ಬೆಳ್ಳಿಯ - ಹಾಗೂ ಬಂಗಾರದ ಪಾತ್ರೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಭಗವಂತನಿಗೆ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬಹುದು .
ದೀಪದ ಪಾತ್ರೆಯು ಆರು ವಿಧವಾಗಿದೆ.
 ಸುವರ್ಣನಿರ್ಮಿತಪಾತ್ರೆ , ಮರದಿಂದ ನಿರ್ಮಿತ , ಲೋಹದಿಂದ ನಿರ್ಮಿತ ಮಣ್ಣಿನಿಂದ ನಿರ್ಮಿತ , ತೆಂಗಿನ ಚಿಪ್ಪಿನಿಂದ ನಿರ್ಮಿತ ತಾಳೆಯ ಚಿಪ್ಪಿನಿಂದ | ನಿರ್ಮಿತವಾದದ್ದು ಹೀಗೆ .

 ಹಸುವಿನ ತುಪ್ಪದಿಂದ ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ಸಮಸ್ತ ಇಷ್ಟ ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತಿಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ . 
ಎಳ್ಳೆಣ್ಣೆಯಿಂದ ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ಅಮಂಗಲ ಪರಿಹಾರವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ . 
ಕುಸುಬೆ ಎಣ್ಣೆಯಿಂದ ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ಕೀರ್ತಿಯು ಹೆಚ್ಚುತ್ತದೆ . 
ಕೊಬ್ಬರಿ ಎಣ್ಣೆಯಿಂದ ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ಸೌಖ್ಯವು ಹೆಚ್ಚುತ್ತದೆ.
ಆಡಿನ ತುಪ್ಪದಿಂದ ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚುವುದು ಭೋಗಕ್ಕೆ ( ಸುಖಾನುಭವಕ್ಕೆ ) ಉತ್ತಮವಾದ ಸಾಧನವು . ಅಂದರೆ ಆಡಿನ ತುಪ್ಪದಿಂದ ದೇವರ ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ಸುಖವು ಸಿಗುತ್ತದೆ . 
ಆದರೆ ಹರಳೆಣ್ಣೆ ಮತ್ತು ಎಮ್ಮಿಯ ತುಪ್ಪವನ್ನು ದೇವರ ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚಲು ಸರ್ವಥಾ ಉಪಯೋಗಿಸಬಾರದು . ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ಒಟ್ಟಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಹಸುವಿನ ತುಪ್ಪ ಎಳ್ಳೆಣ್ಣೆ ಕೊಬ್ಬರಿ ಎಣ್ಣೆ , ಆಡಿನ ತುಪ್ಪ ಇವುಗಳಿಂದ ದೇವರ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬಹುದು .

ದೀಪದ ಬತ್ತಿಯು ಐದು ವಿಧವೆಂದು ಹೇಳಿದ್ದಾರೆ :
ಪದ್ಮಸೂತ್ರಭವಾದರ್ಭಗರ್ಭಸೂತ್ರಸಮುದ್ಭವಾ | ಶಾಣಜಾ ಬಾದರೀ ವಾಪೀ ಫಲಕೋಶೋದ್ಭವಾಥವಾ ವರ್ತಿಕಾ ದೀಪಕೃತ್ಯೇಷು ಸದಾ ಪಂಚವಿಧಾ ಸೃತಾ ||

ಯಾವ ಬತ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ಯಾವ ಫಲ ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತಿಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.

ತಾವರೆ ದಂಟಿನ ನಾರಿನಿಂದ ಬತ್ತಿ ಮಾಡಿ ಉರಿಸಿದರೆ ಸಾರ್ವಭೌಮತ್ವ ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತಿ, ಸಕಲ ಇಷ್ಟಾರ್ಥ ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತಿ.
ಅಗಸೆ ನಾರಿನ ಬತ್ತಿಯ ದೀಪದಿಂದ ಹಸಿವೆ,ನೀರಡಿಕೆ,ಮುಪ್ಪು,ಮೃತ್ಯು,ಶೋಕ,ಮೋಹ ಎಂಬ ಆರು ಅನರ್ಥದಿಂದ ಪರಿಹಾರ ಸಿಗುವುದರ ಜೊತೆ ನಿತ್ಯದಲ್ಲೂ ಯೌವ್ವನ ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತಿ.
ನಾರಿನ ಬತ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ಪಾಪ ನಾಶ ಆಗುತ್ತದೆ ಜ್ಞಾನ ಸಿಗುತ್ತದೆ.
ಹತ್ತಿ ಬತ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ಪಾಪ ನಾಶ ಪುಣ್ಯ ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತಿ ಆಗುತ್ತದೆ.
ಇಷ್ಟೊಂದು ಮಹತ್ವವನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿರುವ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ರಾತ್ರಿಯ ವೇಳೆ ಹಚ್ಚಿಡ ಬಾರದು ಎನ್ನುವುದು ಎಷ್ಟು ಉಚಿತ....?      ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿದ್ದರೆ 24 ಗಂಟೆಯೂ ಹಚ್ಚಿಡಿ. ಸಾಧ್ಯ ಆಗದಿದ್ದರೆ ಎಸ್ಟು ಸಾಧ್ಯವೋ ಅಷ್ಟು ಕಾಲ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿ ಇಡಬಹುದು.

2/27/22, 8:19 AM - Vathsa: 💧*Temper Control*

*There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the fence*

*The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily, gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence. Finally the day came when the boy didn’t lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper*

*The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said “you have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one.”*

*You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won’t matter how many times you say I’m sorry, the wound is still there*

*Make sure you control your temper the next time you are tempted to say something you will regret later*
2/27/22, 9:17 PM - Hema: *ಶಂಕರಾಚಾರ್ಯರು ನೀಡಿರುವ ಉಪದೇಶ*

3/4/22, 10:39 AM - Hema: *ಯಾವ ದೋಷಕ್ಕೆ ಯಾವ ದೀಪ ಹಚ್ಚಬೇಕು? ಇಲ್ಲಿದೆ ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಸರಳ ಪರಿಹಾರ!*

ಒಂದು ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಉರಿಸುವುದರಿಂದ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಯ ಜಾತಕದಲ್ಲಿ ಇರುವ ದೋಷಗಳು ನಿವಾರಣೆಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ದೀಪಾರಾಧನೆಗೆ ಮಹತ್ವದ ಶಕ್ತಿ ಇದೆ. ಯಾವ ದೋಷಕ್ಕೆ ಯಾವ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬೇಕು ಎನ್ನುವುದನ್ನು ಪ್ರತಿಯೊಬ್ಬರೂ ತಿಳಿದುಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕು. ವಿವಿಧ ರೀತಿಯ ಎಣ್ಣೆಗಳು ಮನುಷ್ಯನ ನಾನಾ ರೀತಿಯ ದೋಷಗಳನ್ನು ನಿವಾರಿಸುತ್ತವೆ.

೧, ಗ್ರಹಗಳ ಅಧಿಪತಿ ಸೂರ್ಯದೇವನ ದೋಷ ಇದ್ದರೆ ಪ್ರತಿ ಭಾನುವಾರ ಸೂರ್ಯೋದಯ ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಸೂರ್ಯದೇವನನ್ನು ಸ್ಮರಿಸಿ ತುಪ್ಪದ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬೇಕು.ಇದರಿಂದ ಜೀವನದಲ್ಲಿ ಯಶಸ್ಸು ಸಿಗುವುದು.

೨,ಚಂದ್ರ ದೋಷ ಇದ್ದರೆ ಪ್ರತಿ ಸೋಮವಾರ ರಾತ್ರಿ ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ 6 ರಿಂದ 7 ಗಂಟೆ ಒಳಗಡೆ ತುಳಸಿ ಗಿಡದ ಸಮೀಪ ಕಡಲೆ ಕಾಯಿಯ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬೇಕು. ಕಟಕ ರಾಶಿಯವರು ಚಂದ್ರನಿಗೆ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿ ಪೂಜಿಸಿದರೆ ಪ್ರತಿಕ್ಷಣ ಅವರ ಜೀವನ ಆನಂದಮಯವಾಗಿರುತ್ತದೆ.


೩, ಕುಜದೋಷ ಇದ್ದರೆ ಪ್ರತಿ ಮಂಗಳವಾರ ಮಧ್ಯಾಹ್ನ 3 ರಿಂದ 4 ಗಂಟೆಯಾ ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಕುಜ ಗ್ರಹದ ವಿಗ್ರಹಕ್ಕೆ ತುಪ್ಪದ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬೇಕು. ಮೇಷ ಮತ್ತು ವೃಶ್ಚಿಕ ರಾಶಿಯವರಿಗೆ ಕಾಳಸರ್ಪದೋಷ ಇದ್ದರೂ ಕೂಡ ನಿವಾರಣೆಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.

೪,ಬುಧ ದೋಷಕ್ಕೆ ಬುಧವಾರ ಮಧ್ಯಾಹ್ನ 12 ರಿಂದ 1:30ರ ಒಳಗೆ ಬುಧ ಗ್ರಹದ ಸಮೀಪ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಬೆಳಗಿಸಬೇಕು. ಮಿಥುನ ಮತ್ತು ಕನ್ಯಾ ರಾಶಿಯವರು ಬುಧವಾರ ಕೊಬ್ಬರಿ ಎಣ್ಣೆಯಿಂದ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬೇಕು.ಈ ರೀತಿ ಮಾಡುವುದರಿಂದ ಉದ್ಯೋಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಉನ್ನತ ಸ್ಥಾನವನ್ನು ಕೂಡ ಗಳಿಸಬಹುದು.


೫,ಗುರು ಗ್ರಹದ ದೋಷ ಇದ್ದರೆ ಪ್ರತಿ ಗುರುವಾರ ಮದ್ಯಾಹ್ನ 1:30 ರಿಂದ 3 ಗಂಟೆ ಒಳಗೆ ಗುರುಗ್ರಹದ ವಿಗ್ರಹದ ಸಮೀಪ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬೇಕು. ಧನಸ್ಸು ಮತ್ತು ಮೀನ ರಾಶಿಯವರು ಗುರುವಾರದಂದು ಬೇವಿನ ಎಣ್ಣೆಯ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ವಿದ್ಯಾ ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತಿ ಆಗುತ್ತದೆ.

೬,ಶುಕ್ರ ದೋಷ ನಿವಾರಣೆಗೆ ಶುಕ್ರವಾರದಿಂದ 10:30 ರಿಂದ 12 ಗಂಟೆ ಒಳಗೆ ದೇವಿ ದೇವಾಲಯದಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಂಬೆ ಹಣ್ಣಿನ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬೇಕು. ವೃಷಭ ಮತ್ತು ತುಲಾ ರಾಶಿಯವರು ಶುಕ್ರವಾರದ ದಿನ ಕೊಬ್ಬರಿ ಎಣ್ಣೆಯ ಅಥವಾ ತುಪ್ಪದ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬೇಕು. ಈ ರೀತಿಯಾಗಿ ಮಾಡಿದಾಗ ಉತ್ತಮ ಅರೋಗ್ಯವನ್ನು ಪಡೆಯಬಹುದು.

7,ಶನಿ ದೋಷ ಇದ್ದಾರೆ ಶನಿ ದೇವಾಲಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಏಳ್ಳು ಎಣ್ಣೆ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬೇಕು.ಬೆಳಗ್ಗೆ 9 ರಿಂದ 10:30ರ ಒಳಗೆ ಏಳ್ಳು ಎಣ್ಣೆ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬೇಕು.ಮಕರ ಮತ್ತು ಕುಂಭ ರಾಶಿಯವರು ಶನಿವಾರದಂದು ಏಳ್ಳು ಎಣ್ಣೆ ಹಚ್ಚಿದರೆ ಮನಸ್ಸಿಗೆ ಶಾಂತಿ ಮತ್ತು ಧನಪ್ರಾಪ್ತಿ ಆಗುವುದು.

೮, ಇನ್ನು ನಿಂಬೆಹಣ್ಣಿನ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ದೇವಿ ಸ್ವರೂಪವಾದ ದುರ್ಗಾದೇವಿಗೆ ಬಹಳ ಪ್ರಿಯ ಆಗಿರುವುದರಿಂದ ದೇವಿಯ ಕೃಪೆ ಮತ್ತು ಆಶೀರ್ವಾದ ಸಿಗಲೆಂದು ಹಚ್ಚಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.ಅಷ್ಟೇ ಅಲ್ಲದೆ ಅಮ್ಮನವರ ದೇವಾಲಯದಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಂಬೆ ಹಣ್ಣಿನ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬಹುದು.ಇನ್ನು ಶುಕ್ರವಾರದ ದಿನ ನಿಂಬೆ ಹಣ್ಣಿನ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಿ ನಂತರ ದೇವಿಗೆ ಅಷ್ಟತ್ತೋರ ಮತ್ತು ಪೂಜೆಯನ್ನು ಮಾಡಿಸಬೇಕು.ನಂತರ ಬಂದಿರುವ ಮುತೈದೆಯರಿಗೆ ಅರಿಶಿಣ ಕುಂಕುಮವನ್ನು ಕೊಟ್ಟು ನಮಸ್ಕಾರವನ್ನು ಮಾಡಿ ಅವರ ಆಶೀರ್ವಾದವನ್ನು ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕು.ಅದರೆ ಒಂದೇ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಇಬ್ಬರು ಹೆಂಗಸರು ಒಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ನಿಂಬೆ ಹಣ್ಣಿನ ದೀಪವನ್ನು ಹಚ್ಚಬಾರದು.

3/30/22, 11:31 AM - Prema: What a beautiful answer! 
Comparison between two  "Generations" ....... Everyone must read 👌👌

A youngster asked his father: "How did you people live before with-
No access to technology
No aeroplanes
No internet
No computers
No dramas
No TVs
No air cons
No cars
No mobile phones?"

His Dad replied:
"Just like how your generation lives today with -

No prayers
No compassion
No honor
No respect
No character
No shame
No modesty
No time planning
No sports 
No reading" 

"We, the people that were born between 1940-1980 are the blessed ones. Our life is a living proof:

👉 While playing and riding bicycles, we never wore helmets.
👉 After school, we played until dusk. We never watched TV.
👉 We played with real friends, not internet friends.
👉 If we ever felt thirsty, we drank tap water not bottled water.
👉 We never got ill although we used to share the same glass of juice with four friends.
👉 We never gained weight although we used to eat a lot of rice everyday.
👉 Nothing happened to our feet despite roaming bare-feet.
👉 our mother and father never used any supplements to keep us healthy. 
👉 We used to create our own toys and play with them.
👉 Our parents were not rich. They gave us love, not worldly materials.
👉 We never had cellphones, DVDs, play station, XBox, video games, personal computers, internet chat - but we had real friends.
👉 We visited our friends' homes uninvited and enjoyed food with them.
👉 unlike your world, we had relatives who lived close by so family time and ties were enjoyed together. 
👉 We may have been in black and white photos but you will find colourful memories in those photos.
👉 We are a unique and, the most understanding generation, because *we are the last generation who listened to their parents*. 

*Also , the first who have had to listen to their children.* 
and we are the ones who are still smarter and helping you now to use the technology that never existed while we were your age!!!

We are *LIMITED* edition models ! 

So you better -
*Enjoy us.*
*Learn from us.*
*Treasure us.*

*Before we disappear from this Earth and from  your lives."*💔

3/31/22, 5:35 PM - Kavvi: *It is an eye-watering story of four close friends of school..*

 *Those who have studied up to SSC in the same school..*

 * At that time it was the only luxury hotel in the city..*

 *After the SSC exam, they decided that we should go to that hotel and have tea and breakfast..*


 The four of them hardly deposited forty rupees, it was a Sunday, and at ten thirty they reached the hotel by bicycle.

 *Dinesh, Santosh, Manish and Praveen started talking while having tea and breakfast..*

 The four of them unanimously decided that after fifty years we will meet again in this hotel on April 01..*
 
 Till then we all should work very hard, it will be interesting to see how much progress has been made in this..*
   
 *The friend who comes to the hotel later that day will have to pay the hotel bill for that time..*
     
 * Kalu, the waiter who served him tea and breakfast, was listening to all this, he said that if I stay here, I will wait for all of you in this hotel..*

 * all four separated for further education..*
   
 *He had left the city when Dinesh's father changed, Santosh went to his uncle for further studies, Manish and Praveen got admission in different colleges of the city..*

 *finally Manish also left the city..*
     
 * Days, months, years have passed..*
  
 * In fifty years there was a radical change in that city, the population of the city increased, roads, flyovers, metros changed the appearance of the city..*
  
 Now that hotel had become a five star hotel, waiter Kalu now became Kalu Seth and became the owner of this hotel..*
      
 *Fifty years later, on the scheduled date, April 01, at noon, a luxury car arrived at the door of the hotel..*

 * Dinesh got down from the car and started walking towards the porch, Dinesh now has three jewelery showrooms..*

 * Dinesh reached the hotel owner Kalu Seth, both kept looking at each other..*

 *Kalu Seth said that Praveen sir has booked a table for you a month ago..*

 * Dinesh was very happy that he was the first of the four, so he would not have to pay today's bill, and he would make fun of his friends for this..*

 * Santosh came in an hour, Santosh became a big builder of the city..*
  
 *According to his age, he now looked like an old senior citizen..*

 * Now both were talking and waiting for other friends, third friend Manish came in half an hour..*

 On talking to him, both of them came to know that Manish has become a businessman..

 The eyes of all three friends were going to the door again and again, when will Praveen come..?

 * * in this time Kalu Seth said that a message has come from Praveen sir, you start tea breakfast, I am coming..*

 * All three were happy to meet each other after fifty years..

 The joke went on for hours, but Praveen did not come..
 
 *Kalu Seth said that again Praveen sir's message has come, you all three start eating after choosing your favorite menu..*

 Praveen did not show even after having eaten the bill, as soon as he asked for the bill, all three got the answer that the online bill has been paid..*
       
 *At eight o'clock in the evening, a young man got down from the car and went to the three friends preparing to leave with a heavy heart, all three were left looking at that man..*

 * The young man started saying, I am your friend's son Ravi, my father's name is Praveen Bhai..*

 *Dad told me about your arrival today, he was waiting for this day, but last month he passed away due to a serious illness..*

 *They told me to meet late, if I leave early, they will be sad, because my friends will not laugh when they know that I am not in this world, and they lose the joy of meeting each other  will give..*

 *So he ordered me to come late..*
 
 He also asked me to hug you on his behalf, Ravi spread both his hands..

 The people around were eagerly watching this scene, they thought they had seen this young man somewhere..*
    
 Ravi said that my father became a teacher, and taught me to become a collector, today I am the collector of this city..*
   
 Everyone was amazed, Kalu Seth said that now not after fifty years, *but every fifty days we will meet again and again in our hotel, and every time there will be a grand party from my side..*

 *Keep meeting with your relatives, don't wait for years to meet friends, don't know whose turn comes and don't know..*

 *Be with your family and friends, feel the joy of being alive..*

4/10/22, 12:28 PM - JaSai: *What is the significance of the precious Ramayana and what impact should studying the epic have on us? Bhagawan reminds us today, on the auspicious occasion of Sri Rama Navami.*

*The Ramayana is a guidebook on ideal relations between mother and children, between husband and wife, between brothers, between ruler and the people, between master and servants and many other human relationships. Rama showed compassion to dying eagle Jatayu, which fought with Ravana when he was carrying Sita away to Lanka and Rama gave refuge to Vibhishana, even against fears expressed by Lakshmana. These are examples of Rama's supreme benevolence and magnanimity towards anyone who revered Him or sought His protection. Rama declared to Lakshmana: "Anyone who comes to Me in a spirit of surrender, whoever he might be, is Mine and I am his. I shall give him asylum. This is My vow." Rama was a man pledged to one word, to one wife and to a single arrow. Devotees should install Rama in their hearts and celebrate Ramanavami for achieving Atmic bliss. Going through the epic Ramayana, they should reach the state of "Atma-Rama" (oneness with Universal Spirit). In such a state there is no Ahamkara (ego-sense)*

Wake up to happiness……

“Choose people who :
- Choose you
- Ask how you are
- See you
-Let you be you
-Feel good to your nervous system
-you can breathe easily around
-You don’t need to perform for
- Are good for your mental health
- want to see you win
- Don’t try to control you”
- S. Tozzi

Avoid Toxic people who constantly judge you.

Have a great Wednesday.
Stay safe. Take care.
4/20/22, 8:55 AM - Hema: *SOME SOCIAL RULES THAT MAY HELP YOU:*

1. Don’t call someone more than twice continuously. If they don’t pick up your call, presume they have something important to attend to.

2. Return money that you have borrowed even before the person that borrowed you remember or ask for it. It shows your integrity and character.

3. Never order the expensive dish on the menu when someone is giving you a lunch/dinner.

4. Don’t ask awkward questions like ‘Oh so you aren’t married yet?’ Or ‘Don’t you have kids’ or ‘Why didn’t you buy a house?’ Or why don't you buy a car? For God’s sake it isn’t your problem.

5. Always open the door for the person coming behind you. It doesn’t matter if it is a guy or a girl, senior or junior. You don’t grow small by treating someone well in public.

6. If you take a taxi with a friend and he/she pays now, try paying next time.

7. Respect different shades of opinions. Remember what's 6 to you will appear 9 to someone facing you. Besides, second opinion is good for an alternative.

8. Never interrupt people talking. Allow them to pour it out. As they say, hear them all and filter them all.

9. If you tease someone, and they don’t seem to enjoy it, stop it and never do it again. It encourages one to do more and it shows how appreciative you're.

10. Say *“Thank you”* when someone is helping you.

11. Praise publicly and Criticize privately.

12. There’s almost never a reason to comment on someone’s weight. Just say, *“You look fantastic.”* If they want to talk about losing weight, they will.

13. When someone shows you a photo on their phone, don’t swipe left or right. You never know what’s next.

 14. If a colleague tells you they have a doctors' appointment, don’t ask what it’s for, just say *"I hope you’re okay".* Don’t put them in the uncomfortable position of having to tell you their personal illness. If they want you to know, they'll do so without your inquisitiveness.

15. Treat the cleaner with the same respect as the CEO. Nobody is impressed at how rude you can treat someone below you but people will notice if you treat them with respect.

16. If a person is speaking directly to you, staring at your phone is rude.

17. Never give advice until you’re asked;

18. When meeting someone after a long time, unless they want to talk about it, don’t ask them their age and salary.

19. Mind your business unless anything involves you directly - just stay out of it.

20. Remove your sunglasses if you are talking to anyone in the street. It is a sign of respect. More so, eye contact is as important as your speech.

21. Never talk about your riches in the midst of the poor. Similarly, don't talk about your children in the midst of the barren.

22.After reading a good message try to say       *"Thanks for the message".*

*APPRECIATION* remains the easiest way of getting what you don't have....

6/27/22, 7:22 AM - Jayamma: *BALANCED LIVING ( A must read for all age groups)*

The story of four close friends from school, who studied in the same school up to SSC. 

At that time, there was only one luxury hotel in the city.

After the SSC exam, they decided that they should go to that hotel and have some tea and breakfast. The four of them could hardly collect forty rupees. It was a Sunday and all four of them reached the hotel by bicycle at ten-thirty.

Dinesh, Santosh, Manish, and Praveen started talking while having breakfast and tea. All four of them decided unanimously, that they would meet again after 40 years in the same hotel on 1st April.

"Till then we all should work very hard. It will be interesting to see how much progress has been made after 40 years," they discussed. 

It was also decided that the last one to reach the hotel then, would have to pay the bill for that day.
     
Kalu, the waiter who served them tea and snacks, was listening to all this. He said, "If I stay here till then, I'll be waiting for you all."

All four separated for further education.
   
Dinesh had left the city after his father got relocated, Santosh went to his uncle for further studies, and Manish and Praveen got admission to different colleges in the city.

Eventually, Manish also left the city.
     
Days, months, and years passed.
  
In forty years, the city underwent a radical change. The population of the city increased, and roads, flyovers, and malls changed the appearance of the city.

Now that hotel had become a five-star hotel, the waiter Kalu had now become Mr. Kalu, the owner of this hotel.
      
Forty years later, on the scheduled date, April 1st, at noon, a luxury car came to the door of the hotel.

Dinesh got out of the car and started walking towards the porch. He now had three jewellery showrooms.

Dinesh reached the hotel owner Mr. Kalu, and both of them kept looking at each other. Mr. Kalu said, “Praveen sir had booked a table for you a month back.”

Dinesh was heartily happy that he was the first of the four, so he wouldn't have to pay the bill that day and would make fun of his friends for it.

After a while, Santosh arrived. Santosh had become a big builder of the city. For his age, he now looked like an old senior citizen.

Now, they both were talking and waiting for the other friends. The third friend, Manish also came in half an hour. On talking to him, both of them came to know that Manish was now a businessman. 

The three friends kept looking towards the door again and again, wondering when Praveen would come. 

Soon, Mr. Kalu came to them and said, "A message has come from Praveen sir. He's asked you all to start with snacks, and he'll join you."

All three were happy to meet each other after forty years, laughing and joking for hours, but Praveen did not come.
 
Mr. Kalu said, "Praveen sir has sent another message, you three should order your favourites from the menu and start eating."

The food was ordered, but even after they had finished eating, Praveen did not show up. When the three asked for the bill, they were told that the bill has been paid online. 

At eight o'clock in the evening, a young man got down from the car and with a heavy heart reached the three friends preparing to leave the hotel. The three couldn't take their eyes off the man.

The young man said, "I am your friend's son Ravi, my father's name is Praveen. Dad had told me about your get together today, he was waiting for this day, but he passed away last month due to a serious illness...

He had asked me to come late because if I had come early, it would have made you all sad. Dad had said, "My friends will not laugh if they come to know that I am not in this world, then they would lose the joy of meeting each other... I don't want that."

That's why he ordered me to come late. He also asked me to hug you on his behalf." Ravi spread both his hands with watery eyes.

Everyone around was eagerly watching this scene, they thought they had seen this young man somewhere.
    
Ravi said, "My father became a teacher and gave me a good education to become the collector. Today, I am the collector of this city..."

Everyone was amazed, Mr. Kalu said, "Now, it won't be after forty years, but we will meet in our hotel every month, and each time there will be a grand party from my side...."

*Friends, keep meeting your loved ones, don't wait for any opportunity to meet someone, we never know when it's time to get separated and we may never get to meet again...*

*The journey of life is also like a train journey. When someone's station comes, they will have to be dropped at that moment. Only a few blurry memories would remain!*

*Stay with family, feel the joy of being alive..*

*Keep meeting your loved ones, not only on special days but also on other occasions, and sometimes without any reason too. May the tree of our relationships be nourished by the water of love, for whom we do not have to wait for any reason or opportunity to meet.*

*Dear friends, when you are reading this story, if someone comes to your mind, do talk to them for two minutes. We have all the facilities!*

                         ♾️

*"We must take time for the people around us and enjoy the beauty of life."*

8/14/22, 2:02 PM - JaSai: Friends , while we all r totally engrossed in buying the Indian Flag , there are some set of people who are waiting for 16/Aug ... 

Kindly do not give chance to the people of sick mentality in the country, they do not want to lose any chance to oppose the call of the Prime Minister. There are reports that few people are preparing to record the heinous act of throwing the tricolor in disgraceful conditions on 16th August.
Some people are eagerly waiting for 16th not 15th August so that they can take such pictures of tricolor and make videos to prove that tricolor has been insulted & all this would be blamed on PM .
These people may also try to create such situations that see the tricolor being thrown in the garbage, stained in the mud etc. etc.

Through this post, I request all my members of *Group*, that after hoisting the flag on the roof , balcony of ur house on the three dates of 13,14 and 15, *take it off with respect and wrap it properly on 16th August* 

*Keep it in the cupboard / briefcase / box so that the same flag can be used on other occasions as well* , *No anti-national element should be given a chance to point fingers*

Mera Bharat Mahan . 
Jai Hind 🙏🏼🇮🇳

8/31/22, 3:00 PM - Kavvi: DOCTOR'S TIPS TO WOMEN 

1. You should NOT finish all housework in one day. Those who have done it are stressed and some are already buried.

2. Take time to rest, it's not a sin to sit, put your legs on the table and eat something you like.

3. SLEEP if necessary for headache to disappear. Those who refuse to take vacation leave, take time off or break time, if not, their families will miss them because they have prematurely gone on the journey without return.

4. STOP taking sedatives to sleep, you're destroying your brain and organs. Sometime you'll start forgetting things. Relax your brain, worry less, go for a walk, laugh, smile more, everything will happen eventually.

5. Meditate. Have a quiet time and relax. Breathe fresh air. Breathe out all negativities.

6. Stay in front of your mirror, smile for yourself. That turns on a positive aura around you, so you can shine with your own light.

7. GO buy you a snack or something to drink. Just do something for yourself, even if your partner doesn't do it for you... do it yourself, so you can download things in your head.

8. GET the appliances needed to ease your job and avoid stress as it is women's largest silent killer.

9. Ask help when you don't feel good, do something about it, go to health center, hospital or call some nearby doctor. Don't self medicate.

10. CONTROL YOUR PRESSURE AND SUGAR LEVEL OCCASIONALLY, whether you're sick or not. Doing this has saved a lot of women in the past. 

Trust this good advice I give you and give yourself the value you deserve, love and care, you are a great woman and don't forget you are a BEAUTIFUL CREATION. ❤

In a day we will be starting another trip, with an estimated time of 365 days.
Define your destiny well and embark on the 2023 platform
Anyone who has old grievances, resentments, pendencies, and sadness in their luggage, please unload them at the desk 2022
Passengers who have a smile on their lips, an open heart, and hands ready to build will have a preferential seat, next to the window of happiness.
We recommend that everyone wear the belt of hope and ask that no one, under any circumstances, use the emergency exit during the trip.
If there are periods of turbulence, remain calm and confident.
Enjoy the trip a lot!
Happy 2023
